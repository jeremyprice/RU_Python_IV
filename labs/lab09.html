:mod:`lab09_unittest` --- Module unittest
========================================

#. Create two new exception types: EvenIntegerError and NegativeIntegerError.

#. Create a new class called PositiveOddInt that inherits from **int** and allows one argument
   during instance creation: the initial value. Save the initial value as the instance attribute 
   *value*, or default to 1 if not given. 

#. Write a __str__() method that returns the class name, the lab number ("Lab09"), the address of the 
   object in memory, and the value of the object.
 
#. This class only supports positive, even integers, so check the initial value. Override the special 
   methods for __add__ and __sub__ (subtract) to check for illegal values and raise the appropriate
   exception.

#. Override __pow__() to raise a NotImplementedError instead of doing the exponentiation.

#. Create a class TestPositiveOddInt that uses unittest.TestCase as a base class, and implement test 
   cases to verify basic operation of PositiveOddInt as well as the exceptions it raises. Use the 
   built in test runner unittest.main() to test your new class.
